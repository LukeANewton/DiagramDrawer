# DiagramDrawer
The goal of this project is to create an application to create and modify various technical diagrams.

## Current Features
- Draw UML class diagrams with class boxes and relationships between them
- Move and resize drawn class boxes
- Double-click drawn components to edit contents
- Easily change the relationships between components and switch directions of directed relationships
- Undo the history of changes made with z key
- Save/Load diagrams as XML 
- Export the diagram as a PNG

## Planned Upcoming Features
##### Completing Class Diagrams:
- allow relationships to be moved and resized
- allow relationships to be drawn with multiple points, rather than always be a straight line
- add labels and multiplicities to relationships
##### Other Diagram Types to Eventually Implement:
- entity-relationship diagrams
- use case diagrams
- flowcharts
- state machines
- activity diagrams
